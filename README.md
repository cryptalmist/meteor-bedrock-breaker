# Meteor Bedrock Breaker

Functionality based on [garlic-bred](https://github.com/garlic-bred)'s [easy-bedrock-breaker](https://github.com/garlic-bred/easy-bedrock-breaker) mod.

This addon automates the whole process of breaking bedrock.

### Notes
You need a tool to break the pistons very fast. (Diamond/Netherite Pickaxe with Efficiency 5). Maybe a workaround for that can be found.
